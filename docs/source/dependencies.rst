.. title:: Dependencies


To develop ``scdiffeq``, we built several supporting libraries. Many of these
libraries contain functions that are not necessarily directly relevant to 
``scdiffeq`` and we found that abstracting them into their own package was not
only useful for the development of other projects, but helped to clean up ``scdiffeq``.

That said, developers interested in working with and building upon 
``scdiffeq`` may find utility in documentation of these supporting libraries.
Several of them are linked below.
