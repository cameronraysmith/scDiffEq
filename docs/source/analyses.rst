Here we feature a breakdown of analyses inclucded in the manuscript associated
with ``scdiffeq``. While **Figure 1** contains an overview that does not host
any analyses, **Figure 2** demonstrates the accuracy of *scDiffEq* compared to
other contemporary models. **Figure 3** demonstrates *scDiffEq*'s ability to 
impart *in silico* perturbations to cells then simulate and model the impact of
that perturbation. **Figure 4** describes our effort to study the interpretability
of the model. In this figure, we highlight various aspects of model properties as
they relate to the observed data.
