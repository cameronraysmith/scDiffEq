## LARRY dataset-derived experiments

Planned results will occupy 1-2 main figures and 2 or more supplementary figures. 

### 1. Interpolation Task

We used the framework proposed alongside the publication of the LARRY dataset, which has also been used to evaluate PRESCIENT, which has an overlapping goal and framework for modelling single-cell data to the method we propse here. 

The authors of the PRESCIENT model provided several notebooks for replicating their analysis. I have created a series of notebooks based on these to incorporate the evaluation of scDiffEq.

#### Notebooks and scripts
1. [Data preparation](01.interpolation/nb01.LARRY.data_preparation.interpolation_task.ipynb)
2. [Train models](01.interpolation/)
3. [Model evaluation](01.interpolation/)

#### (planned) Visualized results

* Components of a main figure focused on LARRY
* Supplementary figure focused on the interpolation task

### 2. Fate prediction task
