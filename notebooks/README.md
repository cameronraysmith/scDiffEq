# Notebooks

Example notebooks with useful code to reproduce specific analyses. Organized by dataset. 

## Simulated datasets

* [**2-D simulations**](https://github.com/pinellolab/sc-neural-diffeqs/blob/main/notebooks/2d_toy_simulations.ipynb)
* EMT simulation (**coming soon**)

## EMT scRNA-seq (+ CROP-seq)
*10x scRNA-seq: cell lines stimulated in a dish.*

## LARRY in vitro data
*scRNA-seq with static barcodes*
