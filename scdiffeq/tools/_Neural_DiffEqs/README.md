# Neural Differential Equations Modules

Thus far, we have worked on implementing two types of neural differential equations for single-cell data: (**1**) neural *ordinary* differential equations, the original class of neural ODEs and (**2**) stochastic neural differential equations. 

## (**1**) neural ordinary differential equations


## (**2**) stochastic neural differential equations
