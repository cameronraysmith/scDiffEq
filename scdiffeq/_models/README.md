# Models

### Explanation of organization

this sub-package is "models". hypothetically other models could be placed within this sub-package and the structure would remain hierarchical wherein each model has its own sub-package directory (e.g., scDiffEq). For now, there is a single model in the models sub-package (scDiffEq). This may be found in its own sub-package directory, "_scDiffEq". Within this sub-package is the main module ("model") as well as the ancilliary functions required for use of the model.
